                          Starting something new always feels like stepping into unknown territory.
                          For me, learning HTML was my first dive into the world of coding.<br> 
                          I had heard about it as the "skeleton of the web," but I never really knew what that meant—until I tried it myself.

                  <h2>My Experince</h2>
                    <p>The first thing I learned was that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
                       It’s not a programming language, but rather a way to structure content on the web. <br>
                       I started with the basics: headings , paragraphs, and links . 
                       Writing my first "Hello, World!" inside a browser felt like magic.<br>
                       As I moved on to images, lists, and tables, I realized how each tag has a specific role in building a web page. <br>
                       One of the most satisfying moments was when I created a simple webpage from scratch and saw it working in my browser. 
                       It felt like I was actually building something real.

                    <p>
                       Learning HTML has been a simple yet powerful experience. It taught me how websites are structured and gave me the confidence to explore more.<br> 
                       I now see web pages with new eyes—understanding the code behind what I once took for granted. It’s just the beginning, but I’m excited for what’s next.
